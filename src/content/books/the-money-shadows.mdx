## About the Book

_The Money Shadows_ follows the story of **Elias Renn**, a 34-year-old man drowning in poor decisions, financial anxiety, and self-sabotage. When he meets Dr. Mara Celestine, a behavioural-finance psychologist who studies the emotional drivers behind money habits, his life begins to unravel—and rebuild.

Through therapy sessions, real-world challenges, past-trauma exploration, and intense psychological confrontations, Elias discovers:

- **Why people make irrational financial choices**
- **How emotions override logic**

By the end, Elias must face the ultimate financial test—one that forces him to choose between the beliefs he inherited and the wealth he could build.

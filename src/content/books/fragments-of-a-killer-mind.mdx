## About the Book

In the shadows of a city gripped by fear, Detective Alex Mercer faces his most challenging case yet. Marcus Cole isn't just another serial killer—he's a psychological enigma whose mind operates on levels that defy conventional understanding.

Each murder is meticulously planned, each victim seemingly random, yet connected by threads only Marcus can see. As Alex attempts to profile the killer, he finds himself drawn into a dangerous game where the lines between hunter and hunted blur with each passing day.

The deeper Alex digs, the more he realizes that understanding Marcus means confronting the darkest corners of his own psyche. Every interview, every piece of evidence, every fragment of Marcus's mind reveals uncomfortable truths about human nature, morality, and the thin line that separates the sane from the mad.

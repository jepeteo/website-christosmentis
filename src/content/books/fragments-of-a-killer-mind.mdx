Every move he makes is deliberate, every act an expression of his warped philosophy: that beauty and order can only be found through destruction. When a series of eerily precise murders shocks the nation, the FBI calls in their top consultant—Freya Claire, a seasoned profiler and mother of two whose calm intellect hides a mind as relentless as the man she's hunting. But as Freya delves deeper into James's world, the lines between hunter and hunted begin to blur."

## About the Book

James Alexander White was once an ordinary boy from Portland. Now he's something else entirely - a man whose obsession with structure, silence, and human imperfection has turned him into a designer of death. Every move he makes is deliberate, every act an expression of his warped philosophy: that beauty and order can only be found through destruction.

When a series of eerily precise murders shocks the nation, the FBI calls in their top consultant - **Freya Claire**, a seasoned profiler and mother of two whose calm intellect hides a mind as relentless as the man she's hunting. But as Freya delves deeper into James's world, the lines between hunter and hunted begin to blur. His thoughts echo in her dreams. His symbols appear in her home. And the closer she gets to him, the more she feels the pattern pulling her in.

_Fragments of a Killer Mind_ is a haunting psychological thriller that explores the thin, trembling boundary between order and madness, intellect and obsession, reality and illusion. Written in immersive first-person prose, it takes readers deep into two converging minds—one searching for truth, the other for transcendence.

**In the quiet spaces between thought and action, one question remains:**  
_Can you truly understand darkness without becoming part of it?_

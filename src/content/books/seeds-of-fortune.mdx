## About the Book

**Seeds of Fortune** is a deeply human, cinematic novel that transforms the world of finance into a story of mentorship, resilience, and purpose.

When Alex Carter, a disillusioned young man from Brighton, meets the mysterious retired investor Henry Hartwell, he has no idea that a single conversation will change the trajectory of his life—and his understanding of wealth—forever.

Over twenty evocative chapters, their unlikely friendship unfolds into a journey through life's markets—both financial and emotional. Hartwell teaches Alex the real rules of wealth: patience over panic, wisdom over greed, and purpose over profit. Together, they explore investing, property, risk, and legacy—not as cold strategies, but as reflections of human growth.

But when tragedy strikes and Alex must face the chaos of the market alone, he learns the ultimate lesson:

**True wealth isn't what you earn. It's what you become.**
